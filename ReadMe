Computer Vision: assignment

Using the Fourier transform to perform high-pass filtering on an image. 
Use the code found in the repository https://github.com/dip-course/crashcourse-python-numpy-scipy. The code (which we saw in class) applies a low-pass filter. 
Make direct changes to this code to filter the given image with a high-pass filter of your choice. 
The output is the modified notebook file.
